- Two Ways of interacting with the OS:
  -----------------------------------

  - GUI 
  - CLI 


- Status code of the command is decided by the developer of the command.

- SHELL VARIABLES:
  ---------------

  - SHELL: current shell
    -----
  - USER: current login user
    ----
  - PATH: when we execute the command the os will look for the path of the executables 

  - ?: Status Code of the command.
    --

- PRINT THE VALUE OF VARIABLE:
  ---------------------------
  echo $VARIABLE 

  eg: echo $SHELL 

- SOME COMMANDS:
  -------------

  - date: date
  - cal: calendar
  - which: to know the path of the script
  - exit: to exit the current shell 
  - man: manual of the command

- ADD OUR EXECUTABLE TO THE PATH:
  ------------------------------
 
  1. export PATH=PATH_OF_EXECUTABLE:$PATH 
 
  2. add the PATH to:

	- /etc/profile : global ( not called for user with nologin shell)
        - ~/.bash_profile: user specific
        - ~/.bashrc: user specific variables for bash shell (will be run for every shell)
 

  3. the permission should be executable (chmod 777 filepath)

- cmd.sh 
  ------

  #!/bin/bash (interpreter to use to run this command)
  echo hello
